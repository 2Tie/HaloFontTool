viewer for halo 2+ font files (halo 2 should work out of the box, halo 3 - reach currently requires fiddling in order to select which font in the package to display, and halo 4 uses a different bank size for the character blobs; should be better implemented in the future, but for now here's what i have working.)  
  
right-clicking a halo 2 character will save it to an exports folder in its directory.  
  
  
transparency kinda doesn't look as snazzy as i imagine it should, for stuff like reach vehicle icons - it'll at least look far better than the other halo 2 font viewer i could find though.
